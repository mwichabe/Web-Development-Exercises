          <h2>Color Theory in Graphic Design</h2>
          <p>Color theory plays a crucial role in graphic design, influencing aesthetics, emotions, and communication. Understanding color principles enables designers to create visually appealing and effective designs that resonate with their audience.</p>
          <p>Here are some fundamental concepts of color theory in graphic design:</p>
          <h3>Primary Colors</h3>
          <p>The primary colors, red, blue, and yellow, are the foundation of all other colors. They cannot be created by mixing other colors together.</p>
          <h3>Secondary Colors</h3>
          <p>Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors together. They include orange, green, and purple.</p>
          <h3>Color Harmony</h3>
          <p>Color harmony refers to the pleasing combination of colors in a design. Common color harmonies include complementary, analogous, and triadic schemes.</p>
          <h3>Color Psychology</h3>
          <p>Colors evoke psychological and emotional responses in viewers. For example, red can convey passion or urgency, while blue is often associated with calmness or trust.</p>
          <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
          <p>Contrast is essential for creating visual interest and hierarchy in a design. Using contrasting colors can draw attention to key elements and improve readability.</p>
          <p>By applying color theory principles effectively, graphic designers can enhance the visual impact and communication of their designs, conveying messages with clarity and resonance.</p>
